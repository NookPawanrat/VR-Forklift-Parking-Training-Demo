# VR Forklift Parking Training  

🚀 **An immersive VR simulation designed to train users in forklift operation and parking, built using Unreal Engine.**  

## Overview  
This project is a VR-based forklift training simulation that allows users to practice safe forklift operations in a virtual environment. The simulation includes **realistic physics, interactive controls, and guided training scenarios** to enhance the learning experience.  

## Features  
✅ **Physics-Based Forklift Controls** – Drive, steer, and operate the forklift realistically.  </br>
✅ **Interactive Training Scenarios** – Step-by-step instructions for proper forklift parking. </br> 
✅ **Immersive VR Experience** – Designed for training with interactive elements.  </br>
✅ **User-Friendly UI** – Clear instructions and visual feedback to improve learning.  </br>
✅ **Safety-Focused Design** – Simulates real-world obstacles to enhance operator skills.  </br>

## Controls  
- **Grab & Enter Forklift:** Use VR hand controllers to grab and enter the forklift.  </br>
- **Drive Forward/Backward:** Grab the lever and push/pull to control movement.  </br>
- **Steer the Forklift:** Use the wheel or joystick for directional control.  </br>
- **Complete Parking Challenge:** Navigate through obstacles and park correctly.</br>

## Future Improvements
🔹 Additional Training Levels – More complex parking and handling scenarios. </br>
🔹 Multiplayer Mode – Training simulations with instructors.</br>
🔹 Scoring & Feedback System – Real-time evaluation of performance.</br>
