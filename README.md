# VR Forklift Parking Training  

ðŸš€ **An immersive VR simulation designed to train users in forklift operation and parking, built using Unreal Engine.**  

## Overview  
This project is a VR-based forklift training simulation that allows users to practice safe forklift operations in a virtual environment. The simulation includes **realistic physics, interactive controls, and guided training scenarios** to enhance the learning experience.  

## Features  
âœ… **Physics-Based Forklift Controls** â€“ Drive, steer, and operate the forklift realistically.  
âœ… **Interactive Training Scenarios** â€“ Step-by-step instructions for proper forklift parking.  
âœ… **Immersive VR Experience** â€“ Designed for training with interactive elements.  
âœ… **User-Friendly UI** â€“ Clear instructions and visual feedback to improve learning.  
âœ… **Safety-Focused Design** â€“ Simulates real-world obstacles to enhance operator skills.  

## Controls  
- **Grab & Enter Forklift:** Use VR hand controllers to grab and enter the forklift.  
- **Drive Forward/Backward:** Grab the lever and push/pull to control movement.  
- **Steer the Forklift:** Use the wheel or joystick for directional control.  
- **Complete Parking Challenge:** Navigate through obstacles and park correctly.

## Future Improvements
ðŸ”¹ Additional Training Levels â€“ More complex parking and handling scenarios.
ðŸ”¹ Multiplayer Mode â€“ Training simulations with instructors.
ðŸ”¹ Scoring & Feedback System â€“ Real-time evaluation of performance.
